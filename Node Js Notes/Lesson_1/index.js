// ðŸš€ðŸš€ What is Node Js?
// It's a server environment and not a progamming language, and it runs on various platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac Os etc. and it is completely free to use and also have a bigger community.

// ðŸš€ðŸš€ Why Node Js?
// -->  Ir's easy to learn,
// --> Though it is single threaded but as it uses asynchronous programming which is different than PHP, ASP, so it is fast than other back-end technologies.
// --> It can help us to create, open, read, weite, delete and close files on the server.
// --> It is used for collecting form data.
// --> Node.js can add, delete, modify data in our database.

// ðŸš€ðŸš€ Now let's set-up the environment -->
// for that first we need to download Node.js from this link : --> https://nodejs.org/en/
// and also we need a IDE where we will write the code, so for that we will install Vs Code using the following link : --> https://code.visualstudio.com/download

// ðŸš€ðŸš€ Now let's explore what is modules, what are the different types of modules(There are three types of modules --> Local Modules(created by us), Built-in Modules(no need to install in order to use) and External or Third Party Modules(created by the other developers and need to install while using).
// Module is a set of functions (Like in JS we had Math Modules)
// ðŸš€ Let's now explore how to work with Local Modules : --> -->

// const name = require("./info");

// when exported individually
// name.fullName("Arindam", "Chattopadhyay");
// name.personAge(27);
// name.fullName("Mark", "Karls");
// name.personAge(30);

// when exported all at a go
// name.getName("Arindam", "Chattopadhyay");
// name.getAge(27);
// name.getName("Mark", "Karls");
// name.getAge(30);
